The server created in the document was deleted because I didn't receive any news from you after 30 days, but I didn't delete the
server I used for the API comsuption. Here I give you the links.

Information to connect:

LINK: http://137.184.6.236:3000/ 
USER: test-user-93519
EMAIL: example15462@gmail.com
PASS: https://api.ibizpanel.com/secret/dad693ae3793824d132ce19169ff2bab


Please be aware this is a one-use link password. Once you use it, you must copy it and then you may close it because 
if you close it and don't copy the link you won't be able to login and you'll have to ask for another password link. 
Please let us know if it works for you.
